<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Neotoma is a public database containing fossil data from the Holocene,
Pleistocene, and Pliocene, or approximately the last 5.3 million years.
The database stores associated physical data from fossil bearing
deposits, for example sediment loss-on-ignition and geochemical data.
The database also stores data from modern samples that are used to
interpret fossil data.</p>
<p>The initial development of Neotoma is funded by a grant from the U.S.
National Science Foundation Geoinformatics program. This grant is
collaborative between University <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4"><span id="id1"></span>[1]_</span></a> and the Museum <a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6"><span id="id2"></span>[2]_</span></a>. It has five
Principle Investigators, Russell W. Graham ( ), Eric C. Grimm ( ),
Stephen T. Jackson ( of ), Allan C. Ashworth ( ), and John W. (Jack)
Williams (). The database is served from the Center for Environmental
Informatics at .</p>
<p>Initially, data are being merged from four existing databases: the
Global Pollen Database, FAUNMAP (a database of mammalian fauna), the
North American Plant Macrofossil Database, and a fossil beetle database
assembled by Allan Ashworth. The design of this database is such that
many other kinds of fossil data can easily be incorporated in the
future, for example, ostracodes, diatoms, chironmids, and freshwater
mussels.</p>
<p>The existing databases were developed in the 1990’s and have not been
updated structurally since. New data have been added, but the structures
of these databases have not changed, despite significant advances in
database and internet technology. Although structurally different, these
databases contain similar kinds of data, and merging them was quite
practical. The rationale for this merging was twofold: (1) to facilitate
analyses of past biotic communities at the ecosystem level and (2) to
reduce the overhead in maintaining and distributing several independent
databases..</p>
<p>The new Neotoma database was initially designed by E. C. Grimm and
implemented in Microsoft® Access®. This database will be ported to a
higher end RDBMS for Internet distribution, but it will continue to be
distributed as a standalone Access database for researchers who need
access to the entire database.</p>
<div class="section" id="whence-neotoma">
<h2>Whence Neotoma<a class="headerlink" href="#whence-neotoma" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the original NSF proposal, this database was called a “Late Neogene
Terrestrial Ecosystem Database.” At the time this proposal was written,
the Neogene Period included the Miocene, Pliocene, Pleistocene, and
Holocene epochs. However, a proposal before the International Commission
on Stratigraphy would elevate the Quaternary to a System or Period
following the Neogene and terminate the Neogene at the end of Pliocene.
Because this proposal renders the Neogene description of this database
obsolete, a new name was sought. Numerous names and companion acronyms
were considered, but none engendered enthusiastic support. B. Brandon
Curry proposed the name Neotoma, and this name struck a fancy. <em>Neotoma</em>
is the genus for the packrat. Packrats are prodigious collectors of
anything in their territory, and moreover they are collectors of fossil
data. They collect plant macrofossils and bones, and pollen is preserved
in their amberat—hardened, dried urine, which impregnates their middens
and preserves them for millennia.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rationale">
<h2>Rationale<a class="headerlink" href="#rationale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Paleobiological data from the recent geological past have been
invaluable for understanding ecological dynamics at timescales
inaccessible to direct observation, including ecosystem evolution,
contemporary patterns of biodiversity, principles of ecosystem
organization, particularly the individualistic response of species to
environmental gradients, and the biotic response to climatic change,
both gradual and abrupt. Understanding the dynamics of ecological
systems requires ecological time series, but many ecological processes
operate too slowly to be amenable to experimentation or direct
observation. In addition to having ecological significance, fossil data
have tremendous importance for climatology and global change research.
Fossil floral and faunal data are crucial for climate-model verification
and are essential for elucidating climate-vegetation interactions that
may partly control climate.</p>
<p>Basic paleobiological research is site based, and paleobiologists have
devoted innumerable hours to identifying, counting, and cataloging
fossils from cores, sections, and excavations. These data are typically
published in papers describing single sites or small numbers of sites.
Often, the data are published graphically, as in a pollen diagram, and
the actual data reside on the investigator’s computer or in a file
cabinet. These basic data are similar to museum collections, costly to
replace, sometimes irreplaceable, and their value does not diminish with
time. Also similar to museum collections, the data require cataloging
and curation. Whereas physical specimens of large fossils, such as
animal bones, are typically accessioned into museums, microfossils, such
as pollen, are not accessioned, and the digital data are the primary
objects, and their loss is equivalent to losing valuable museum
specimens. The integrated database that we propose ensures safe,
long-term archiving of these data.</p>
<p>Large independent databases exist for fossil pollen, plant macrofossils,
and mammals: the Global Pollen Database (GPD), the North American Plant
Macrofossil Database (NAPMD), and FAUNMAP. In addition, a database of
fossil beetles (BEETLE) has been assembled, but it is not yet publicly
available. These databases have become essential cyberinfrastructure.
Nevertheless, they were developed as standalone databases in the early
1990’s with PC database software. GPD and NAPMD are in Paradox®; FAUNMAP
is in Access. Since initial database development, emphasis has been
placed on ingest of new and legacy data. However, database and Internet
technology have advanced greatly in the past 15 years, and the current
relational database software, ingest programs, data retrieval
algorithms, output formats, and analysis tools are outdated and minimal.
Moreover, the databases are not linked, so that integrated analyses are
difficult.</p>
<p>Although GPD, NAPMD, and FAUNMAP were developed independently, they have
much in common. The basic data of all three databases as well as BEETLE
are essentially lists of taxa from cores, excavations, or sections,
often with quantitative measures of abundance. The three databases
include similar metadata. The objective of Neotoma is to build a unified
data structure that will incorporate all of these databases. The
database will initially incorporate pollen, plant macrofossil, mammal,
and beetle data. However, the database designed facilitates the
incorporation of all kinds of fossil data.</p>
<p>Various teams of investigators have developed databases for
paleobiological data that have been project or discipline based,
including the four databases to be integrated in this project. However,
long-term maintenance and sustainability have been problematic because
of the need to secure continuous funding. Nevertheless, these databases
have become the established archives for their disciplines and, new data
are continuously contributed. However, because of funding hiatuses, long
spells may intervene between times of data contribution and their public
availability. For example, the plant macrofossil database has not
incorporated any new data since 1999. The number of different databases
and disciplines exacerbates the problem, because each database requires
a database manager. Consolidation of informatics technology helps
address this overhead issue. However, specialists are still essential
for management and supervision of data collection and quality control
for their disciplines or organismal groups.</p>
<p>The purposes of Neotoma are (1) to facilitate studies of ecosystem
development and response to climate change, (2) to provide the
historical context for understanding biodiversity dynamics, including
genetic diversity, (3) to provide the data for climate-model validation,
(4) to provide a safe, long-term, low-cost archive for a wide variety of
paleobiological data. Site-based studies are invaluable in their own
right, and they are the generators of new data. However, much is gained
by marshalling data from geographic arrays of sites for synoptic,
broad-scale ecosystem studies. In order to carry out such studies
efficiently, a queryable database is required. Thus, it is much more
than an archive; it is essential cyberinfrastructure for
paleoenvironmental research. The database facilitates integration,
synthesis, and understanding, and it promotes information sharing and
collaboration. The individual databases have been extensively used for
scientific research, with several hundred scientific publications
directly based upon data drawn from these databases. This project will
enhance those databases and will continue their public access. By
integrating these databases and by simplifying the contributor
interface, we can reduce the number of people necessary for
community-wide database maintenance, and thereby help ensure their
long-term sustainability and existence.</p>

<p>In an early effort, the Cooperative Holocene Mapping Project
(COHMAP&nbsp;Members 1988, Wright et al. 1993) assembled pollen data in the
1970s and 1980s to test climate models. Although data-model comparison
was the principal objective of the COHMAP project, the synoptic analyses
of the pollen data, particularly maps showing the constantly shifting
ranges of species in response to climate change, were revelatory and led
to much ecological insight (e.g. Webb 1981, 1987, 1988).</p>
<p>The COHMAP pollen “database” consisted of a multiplicity of flat files
with prescribed formats for data and chronologies. FORTRAN programs were
written to read these files and to assemble data for particular
analyses. Thompson Webb III managed the COHMAP pollen database at , but
as the quantity of data increased, data management became increasingly
cumbersome. Clearly, the data needed to be migrated to a relational
database management system. Discussions with E. C. Grimm led to the
initiation of the North American Pollen Database (NAPD) at the in 1990.</p>
<p>At the same time in , the International Geological Correlation Project
IGCP 158 was conducting a major collaborative synthesis of
paleoecological data, primarily of pollen, and the need for a pollen
database became painfully obvious. In the forward to the book resulting
from this project (Berglund et al. 1996), J.L. de Beaulieu describes the
role that this project had in launching the European Pollen Database. A
workshop to develop a European Pollen Database (EPD) was held in in
1989. North American representatives also attended, and the organizers
of NAPD and EPD commenced a long-standing collaboration to develop
compatible databases. NAPD and EPD held several joint workshops and
developed the same data structure. Nevertheless, the two databases were
independently established, partly because Internet capabilities were not
yet sufficient to easily manage a merged database. The pollen databases
were developed in Paradox, which at the time was the most powerful RDBMS
readily available for the PC platform. NAPD and EPD established two
important protocols: (1) the databases were relational and queryable and
(2) they were publicly available. As the success the NAPD-EPD
partnership escalated, working groups initiated pollen databases for
other regions, including the Latin American Pollen Database (LAPD) in
1994, the Pollen Database for and the Russian Far East (PDSRFE) in 1995,
and the African Pollen Database (APD) in 1996. At its initial
organizational workshop, LAPD opted to merge with NAPD, rather than
develop a standalone database, and the Global Pollen Database was born.
PDSRFE also followed this model. APD developed independently, but uses
the exact table structure of GPD and EPD. Pollen database projects have
also been initiated in other regions, and the GPD contains some of these
data, including the Indo-Pacific Pollen Database and the Japanese Pollen
Database.</p>
<p>The pollen databases contain data from the Holocene, Pleistocene, and
Pliocene, although most data are from the last 20,000 years. Included
are fossil data, mainly from cores and sections, and modern surface
samples, which are essential for calibrating fossil data. NAPD data are
not separate from the GPD, but rather NAPD is the North American subset
of GPD. EPD has both public and restricted data—a concession that had to
be made early on to assuage some contributors.</p>

<h3>North American Plant Macrofossil Database<a class="headerlink" href="#north-american-plant-macrofossil-database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Plant macrofossils include plant organs generally visible to the naked
eye, including seeds, fruits, leaves, needles, wood, bud scales, and
megaspores. Synoptic-scale mapping of plant macrofossils from modern
assemblages (Jackson et al. 1997) and fossil assemblages (Jackson et al.
1997, Jackson et al. 2000, Jackson and Booth 2002) have shown the
utility of plant macrofossils in providing spatially and taxonomically
precise reconstructions of past species ranges. Although plant
macrofossil records are spatially precise, synoptic networks of
high-quality sites can scale up to yield aggregate views of past
distributions (Jackson et al. 1997). In addition, macrofossils, with
their greater taxonomic resolution, augment the pollen data by providing
information on which species might have been present, and can resolve
issues of long-distance transport (Birks 2003).</p>
<p>The North American Plant Macrofossil Database (NAPMD) has been directed
by S.T. Jackson at the . Highest priority has been placed on data from
the last 30,000 years, although some earlier Pleistocene and late
Pliocene data are included. The database originated as a research
database for selected taxa from Late Quaternary sediments of eastern
North America (Jackson et al. 1997). In 1994, an effort was initiated
with NOAA funding to build on this foundation to develop a cooperative,
relational database comprising all of , a longer time span, and all
plant taxa.</p>
<p>The structure of NAPMD was adapted from the pollen database and is also
in Paradox. The principal modifications made to the pollen database
structure to accommodate plant macrofossils were those to cope with
different organs from the same species and to deal with the various
quantitative measures of abundance. The database also includes surface
samples, which are useful for interpretation of fossil data.</p>

<h3>FAUNMAP<a class="headerlink" href="#faunmap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>R.W. Graham, E.L. Lundelius, Jr., and a group of Regional Collaborators
organized a project to develop a database for late Quaternary faunal
data from the , which the U.S. NSF funded in 1990. This project had a
research agenda, and its seminal paper focused on the individualistic
behavior displayed by animal species (FAUNMAP&nbsp;Working&nbsp;Group 1996).</p>
<p>Two FAUNMAP databases exist, FAUNMAP I and FAUNMAP II. Both databases
were coordinated by R. W. Graham and E. L. Lundelius, Jr. and funded by
NSF. Both are relational databases for fossil mammal sites. The data
were extracted from peer-reviewed literature, selected theses and
dissertations, and selected contract reports for both paleontology and
archaeology. Unpublished collections were not included. Data were
originally captured in Paradox but were later migrated to Access.</p>
<p>FAUNMAP I contains data from sites in the lower 48 states that date
between 500 BP and ~40,000 BP. Funding for this project ended in 1994,
with the production of two major publications by the FAUNMAP Working
Group (1994, 1996), as well as numerous other publications by individual
members and by many others who accessed the database on-line. Graham and
Lundelius continued the FAUNMAP project, developing FAUNMAP II with
funding from NSF beginning in 1998. FAUNMAP II shares the same structure
as FAUNMAP I but expands the spatial coverage to include and and extends
the temporal coverage to the Pliocene (5 Ma). In addition, sites
published since 1994, when FAUNMAP I was completed, have been added for
the contiguous 48 states. In all, FAUNMAP I and II contain more than
5000 fossil-mammal sites with more than 600 mammal species for all of
North America north of Mexico that range in age from 0.5 ka to 5 Ma­.</p>
<p>The detailed structure of the FAUNMAP database is described in FAUNMAP
Working Group (1994). Sites identified by name and location were
subdivided into Analysis Units (AU’s), which varied from site to site
depending upon the definitions used in the original publications (e.g.,
stratigraphic horizons, cultural horizons, excavation levels,
biostratigraphic zones). All data (i.e. taxa identified and counts of
individual specimens) and metadata (sediment types, depositional
environments, facies, radiometric and other geochronological dates,
modifications of bone) were captured by AU. This structure allows for
the extraction of information at either the level of the site or the
smallest subdivision (AU). The AU permits fine-scale temporal resolution
and analysis. Similar to GPD and NAPMD, FAUNMAP contains archival and
research tables. Similar to the plant macrofossil database, FAUNMAP
contains a variety of quantitative measures of abundance, and presence
data are more commonly used for analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="beetle">
<h3>BEETLE<a class="headerlink" href="#beetle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many beetles have highly specific ecological and climatic requirements
and are valuable indicators of past environments (Morgan et al. 1983,
Ashworth 2001, 2004). They are one of the most diverse groups of
organisms on earth, and of the insects, perhaps the most commonly
preserved as fossils. Allan Ashworth has assembled a database of fossil
beetles from . The data, which were recorded in Excel, contain 5523
individual records of 2567 taxa from 199 sites and 165 publications.
Metadata include site name, latitude and longitude, lithology of
sediment, absolute age, and geological age. The basic data are similar
to plant and mammal databases—lists of taxa from sites. The metadata
have not been recorded to the extent of the other databases, especially
chronological data, but Ashworth has resolved the taxonomic issues and
has assembled the publications, so that the additional metadata can be
easily pulled together.</p>

<p>The existing databases have been used widely for a variety of studies.
Because the databases have been available on-line, precise determination
of how many publications have made use of them is difficult. In
addition, the databases are widely used for instructional purposes.
Below are examples of the kinds of people who have used these databases
and who we expect will find the new, integrated database even more
useful.</p>
